# AI Usage Report – Edusity: Responsive React Education Website

## Project Summary:
Built a modern, fully responsive educational website using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key sections include Hero Banner, About Us, Courses, Testimonials, and Contact Form with clean UI and responsive design.

## AI Tools Used:
- ChatGPT: For code generation, responsive layout suggestions, and design ideas.
- GitHub Copilot: For writing repetitive code such as props passing, component structure, and CSS classes.
- v0.dev (optional): For quickly prototyping UI components (e.g., course cards, testimonial layout).

## Example Prompts Used with ChatGPT:
1. “Create a responsive navigation bar in React with animated mobile menu using Tailwind CSS”
2. “Design a course card component with hover animation using HTML and CSS”
3. “Write smooth scroll functionality for navigation links in JavaScript”
4. “How to create a testimonial slider in React using basic CSS?”

## AI Tool Usage Breakdown:
- Component Planning: Used ChatGPT to plan the structure of components like Hero, Courses, and Footer.
- UI/UX Improvements: Asked ChatGPT for UI suggestions (e.g., “What should be in an About Us section for an education site?”)
- Debugging Help: Used ChatGPT to fix responsive layout bugs and alignment issues.
- Copilot Usage: Autocompleted classNames, React hooks setup (e.g., useState, useEffect) in small components.

## Impact of AI Tools:
- Reduced development time by ~30%.
- Improved design consistency and code readability.
- Faster debugging and smoother animation implementation.
